```

**With ontology active:** also add `class: <ClassName>` (must match a class in `wiki/ontology.yaml` axes) and a `properties:` block with the fields listed in that class's definition. Derive field names from the ontology — do not invent fields not declared there. Add `relations:` for typed links. Full frontmatter schema → `references/ontology-commands.md`.

## Concept Page

`wiki/concepts/ConceptName.md` — TitleCase filename

```markdown
---
title: 'Concept Name'
type: concept
tags: []
sources: [slug1, slug2]

One-paragraph definition.

## Discussed In

**With ontology active:** same extension as Entity Page — `class:`, `properties:`, and `relations:` derived from the ontology class definition. Full frontmatter schema → `references/ontology-commands.md`.
